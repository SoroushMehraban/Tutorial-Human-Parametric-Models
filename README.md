# CSC2503 Tutorial: Human Parametric Models
This is a tutorial repository for CSC2503 - Foundations of Computer Vision course at the University of Toronto. In this tutorial, we will explore human parametric models such as SMPL, SMPL-X, and FLAME. We will learn how to use these models for 3D human body and face reconstruction.
